Peterson did mention some questions about grammar conlangers should ask themselves, inspired by Thomas Payne's book Describing Morphosyntax:

Do your nouns have all the inflections you want them to have? (Number, case, gender, possession…)
Do your verbs have all the inflections you want them to have? (Tense, aspect, mode, agreement, incorporation, valency…) Are there auxiliaries to augment your TMA set or not?
Do you have pronouns? Which? In which number and gender combinations? What about demonstratives? How many distances, if any? What about question words?
Can you handle all the basic clause types? (Declarative sentences, yes/no questions, wh-questions, commands, if/then statements, “I wonder” statements, lists, topic/comment structures, tag questions, relative clauses, subordinate clauses, coordination…)
Do you have a number system? How does it handle very large numbers or very small (i.e. less than one) numbers—or is it supposed to be able to?
Do you have a writing system? What kind? How does it handle your number system? Does it have punctuation? Does it have any extra characters that people use all the time but are not necessarily a part of the system proper?
That’s a start, anyway. Lots of stuff I missed, but languages are big things. Lots to do with them.
